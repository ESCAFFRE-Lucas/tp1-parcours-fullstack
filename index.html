            <ul>
                <li> ...Jonathan is the only character to appear in absolutely every chapter of the game he was introduced to.</li>
                <li> ...Josuke was Araki's favorite pre-SBR Jojo, he explains that due to the staging in Morioh's daily life,
                    he felt more attached to Josuke and considered him a friend. Conversely,
                    Jotaro is "rather someone who is admired as a hero"</li>
                <li> ...Joseph is the longest-lived JoJo to date.
                    Araki said in an interview that he was "a bit dumb but still alive" during the events of Stone Ocean,
                    giving him a confirmed maximum age of 91.</li>
