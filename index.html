                is a Japanese manga series written and illustrated by Hirohiko Araki.

                and was transferred to the monthly seinen manga magazine Ultra Jump in 2005.
                The series is divided into nine story arcs, each following a new protagonist bearing the "JoJo"

                <li> ...Josuke was Araki's favorite pre-SBR Jojo, he explains that due to the staging in Morioh's daily
                    life,
                    he felt more attached to Josuke and considered him a friend. Conversely,
                    Jotaro is "rather someone who is admired as a hero"

                    A first in franchise history and perhaps the first sign that the Master isn't an immortal vampire,
                    despite all the memes surrounding his seeming eternal youth.

            Few of the manga writers have exerted such an influence on their contemporaries.
            With JoJo's Bizarre Adventure, started in 1986, Hirohiko Araki signs a capital work,
            so far gone in the deluge of superpowers and in the strange that we still feel the shock wave in today's
            production.
            Following the tribulations of the Joestar dynasty over several decades,
            the creator indulged in countless styling exercises,
            giving birth to ever more whimsical and memorable characters.
            After two first arcs that laid the foundations of the style,
            Phantom Blood and Battle Tendency, the series gained further popularity by introducing the principle of
            stands,
            psychic doubles of the mind, in the Stardust Crusaders chapter,
            centered around the popular Jotarô Kujô and the terrifying Dio.
